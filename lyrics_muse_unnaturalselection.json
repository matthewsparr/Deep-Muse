(we have not been chosen)\nInjustice is the norm\nYou won't be the first and you know you won't be the last\n\n[Refrain]\nOcean! Ocean! OCEAN!\n\n[Chorus 1]\nI want the truth! I want the truth! I want the truth!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/99c90444f6db47f6abd1ec2e44502da5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Muse"}
