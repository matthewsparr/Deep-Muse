A big freeze is heading our way\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe are hiding to nowhere\nWe still hope (hope), but our dreams are not the same, no\nAnd I, I lost before I started\nI'm collapsing in stellar clouds of gas\n\n[Refrain]\nHeal me - what words just can't convey\nFeel me - don't let the sun in your heart decay\n\n[Verse 3]\nFight (fight), or will you show me mercy? (mercy)\nWe've expelled (expelled) the goodness from our hearts (hearts)\nAre you here (here) just to prove you're winning? (winning)\nCan you hole up, and ride out this electrical storm?\n\n[Verse 4]\nWe destroyed something beautiful\nWe have faith (faith), but our truths are not the same, no\nDon't give up (up),don't let the magic leave us (leave us)\nStop the loneliest force becoming king of the universe\n\n[Refrain]\nHeal me - what words just can't convey\nFeel me - don't let the sun in your heart decay\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 2/4 Reprise]\nDon't give up, don't let the magic leave us\nWe're collapsing in stellar clouds of gas\n\n[Refrain]\nHeal me - what words just can't convey\nFeel me - don't let the sun in our hearts decay", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e00c2cd9627558026a8fe51f598f0604.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Muse"}
