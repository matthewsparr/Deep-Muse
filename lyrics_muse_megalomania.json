Could someone tell me please\nThe good news is she can't have babies and won't accept gifts from me\nWhat are they for? They'll just grow up and break the laws you've loved\n\n[Hook]\nTake off your disguise\nI know that underneath it's me\n\nWho are you oooh\n\n[Verse 2]\nUseless device, it won't suffice\nI want a new game to play\nWhen I am gone it won't be long before I disturb you in the dark\nAnd paradise comes at a price that I am not prepared to pay\nWhat were we built for? Will someone tell me please\n\n[Hook]\nTake off your disguise\nI know that underneath it's me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/904c2925e5c15fe69a1851432593b75a.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Muse"}
