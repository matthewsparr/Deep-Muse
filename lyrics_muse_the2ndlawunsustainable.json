An economy based on endless growth is\n\nUnsustainable\nYou're unsustainable\n\nRun\n\nThe fundamental laws of thermodynamics will place fixed limits on technological innovation and human advancement\nIn an isolated system the entropy can only increase. A species set on endless growth is\n\nUnsustainable\nYou're unsustainable", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e00c2cd9627558026a8fe51f598f0604.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Muse"}
