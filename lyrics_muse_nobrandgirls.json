We'll cross the rainbow of miracles\n\nWalls (Hi Hi Hi) Can be demolished (Hi Hi Hi) Can be toppled\nSummon more courage from within yourself\n(Hi Hi Hi) They can be demolished (Hi Hi Hi) They can be toppled\nBravely, show us our future!\n(Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!\nYeah, we're not gonna lose!)\n\nHurting each other is No good\nFalling out is No good\nMisunderstanding love is a bitter feeling\n\nThe pain in your chest is No Good (hurry-up!)\nGiving up is No good (hurry-up!)\nYep, if we can become (Strong) Our feelings can come true (Yes, I go!)\n\nThe place we desire is (Far)\nIt's still far, far off (Where is it?)\nGet closer with a jump\n(Today) As you reach up\n(Firmly) And I reach up, too\n(Oh yeah!) We'll search for the vow that we made that day\n\nThe darkness (Hi Hi Hi) Let's blow it away (Hi Hi Hi) Let's drive it away\nYou can change the present from within yourself\n(Hi Hi Hi) Let's blow it away (Hi Hi Hi) Let's drive it away\nBravely, show us our future!\nThat's right, we're all set!\n\n(Oh yeah!
